 [Regression] You will implement linear regression as part of this question for the dataset provided. For each sub-question, you are expected to report the following - (i) plot of the best fit curve, (ii) equation of the best fit curve along with coefficients, (iii) value of final least squared error over the test data and (iv) scatter plot of model output vs expected output and for both train and test data. You can also generate a .csv file with your predictions on the test data which we should be able to reproduce when we run your command-line instruction.
Note that you can only regress over the points in the train dataset and you are not supposed to fit a curve on the test dataset. Whatever solution you get for the train data, you have to use that to make predictions on the test data and report results.

part(a). Use standard linear regression to get the best fit curve. Vary the maximum degree term of the polynomial to arrive upon an optimal solution.
part(b).In the above problem, increase the maximum degree of the polynomial such that the curve overfits the data.
part(c).Use ridge regression to reduce the overfit in the previous question, vary the value of lambda (λ) to arrive at the optimal value. Report the optimal λ along with other deliverables previously mentioned.
